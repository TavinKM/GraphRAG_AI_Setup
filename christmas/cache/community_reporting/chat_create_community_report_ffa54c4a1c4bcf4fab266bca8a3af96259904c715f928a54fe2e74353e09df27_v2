He was Scrooge's former business partner, and their professional relationship was likely built on a foundation of friendship. Unfortunately, Jacob Marley has since passed away, leaving behind a lasting impact on Scrooge's life.\n\nAs a ghost, Jacob Marley has visited Scrooge before, serving as a harbinger of warning and caution. His spectral presence is a manifestation of his unfinished business in the mortal realm, where he was once a close friend to Scrooge.
